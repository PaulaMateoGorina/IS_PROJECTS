Note that some of the assets are looking up towards the sky and do not completely flat on the ground.
This is intentional, so that when they are displayed the objects are recognizable.
In the project, you will find 2 empty parent objects named Assets and Test_Layout. 
In assets, we have all the assets that we will be using for the project (it is about getting requests to construct different buildings), while in Test_Layout we have a test on how we would place the assets in our final project.
We have simulated a forest with various materials, namely: rocks, water, clay and wood.
To see one or the other, go to the inspector of the empty parents and check / uncheck the corresponding boxes.

The assets we have used come from various packs from the unity store, here are the references for those:
