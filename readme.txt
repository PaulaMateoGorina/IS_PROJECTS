Note that some of the assets are looking up towards the sky and do not completely flat on the ground.
This is intentional, so that when they are displayed the objects are recognizable.
We have added a test layout on how we would place the objects for the projects, to see it, just uncheck the checkbox of the Assets empty object, and check the Test layout one (in the inspector).
